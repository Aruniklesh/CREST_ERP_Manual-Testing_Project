# CREST_ERP_Manual-Testing_Project

This project details the manual testing procedures, scenarios, and test cases for the Crest ERP web applications. The process begins with requirement analysis, where testers gather all necessary documents and inputs to understand the functionalities and requirements of the ERP modules. 
This is followed by test planning, where the scope and objectives of testing are defined, resources and tools are identified, and timelines are estimated. Detailed test cases are then developed, covering each function or feature with clear steps, expected results, and necessary preconditions.
Scenarios for testing include various user interactions and system operations across modules such as Sales, Facility, Procurement, Inventory, and Manufacturing. 
The goal is to ensure that all customer requirements are met and to identify and solve any bugs. This structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage and high-quality outcomes for the ERP web applications.
